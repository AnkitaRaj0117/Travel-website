            <h1>Our History </h1>
            <p>A rare stone with an ancient ogham inscription was discovered by Coventry geography teacher while weeding his flowerbed. Graham Senior was digging up weeds and rocks in his garden on May 28th, 2020, when just four or five inches below the surface he encountered up a quasi-rectangular stone with parallel and diagonal incisions. He washed it and sent a photograph of the stone to an archaeologist relative of his who thought it worth reporting to the Portable Antiquities Scheme. The finds liaison officer sent photos to a University of Glasgow professor who confirmed that the markings were ogham script.</p>
            <h1>Our Ethics </h1>
            <p>A difficulty for academic writers is managing the dual role of both knowing and not knowing, of both showing the way and not finding it. There is an expectation that such writers should already have the knowledge they are writing about, that they should know the way they show others right from the start. As readers, we are naturally delighted and grateful to share the authorsâ€™ knowledge and insight.</p>
